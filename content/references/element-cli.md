## Installing Element CLI

To install Element CLI, run this command in your terminal:

```shell
npm install -g @volusion/element-cli
```

Use the same command above to update your Element CLI to the latest version.

## Commands

### Login

This command prompts you to give your username and password. Use the same credentials that you use to log in to [Volusion Admin](https://www.volusion.com/login).

#### Login Usage

```shell
element login
```

### New Block

This command creates a new starter block with the given block name.

#### New Block Usage

```shell
element new BlockName
```

### Publish

This command publishes a block to the Block Theme Registry for use on Element stores and Site Designer. You will get a warning if your block does not include a thumbnail.png image in its root directory. The image should be 300 pixels wide, and not taller than a 3:2 aspect ratio.

#### Publish Usage

```shell
element publish -n Name
```

#### Publish Options

- **[-n, --name NAME]** This is a required option. The provided name will appear in Site Designer when adding your block to a theme.
- **[-c, --category CATEGORY]** Element CLI will provide an interface prompting you with categories to choose fromâ€”feel free to leave this option off.
- **[-m, --major-version]** See "[Track Block Versions](/how-to/track-block-versions)" for details on when to publish a new major version.

### Update

This command updates your existing block in the Block Theme Registry.

#### Update Usage

```shell
element update
```

#### Update Options

- **[-p, --toggle-public]** If your agency has permission to change this, it will allow you to make the block available to users outside of our organization.
- **[-u, --unminified]** This is an option for skipping the minification process and is useful for debugging.

### Rollback

This command rolls back your existing block to a previously released version in the Block Theme Registry. If you had multiple minor releases linked to the major release, every rollback command will jump back one release until reaching the major. The major version cannot be rolled back.

#### Rollback Usage

```shell
element rollback
```

#### Rollback Options

No options.

### Release

This command releases your existing block and pushes it live to the public. Note that people outside of your organization will not be able to see it until it has been updated and toggled to `public`. You may not have permission to do this yourself.

#### Release Usage

```shell
element release
```

#### Release Options

- **[-n, --note]** This is a release note viewable in Site Designer that displays the note from the major release or the most recent minor release.
