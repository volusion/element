Sometimes, your blocks may need to read URI parameters from the page so that you can get dataâ€”such as the name of the particular product or categoryâ€”that the shopper is viewing.

These URI parameters are also known as "pageVars" in the Element ecosystem.

This guide will show you how to set up a pageVar in your block's config so that the value will be readable in your block code.

## 1. Create a Private Property for Your pageVar

Locate the definition of your `configSchema` in your block code. Add a new `ElementPropTypes.readOnly` property to your config and set `isPrivate` to `true`. Using `isPrivate` will prevent merchants using your block from seeing this setting.

Example with a property called `productSlug`:

```javascript
export const getConfigSchema = ElementPropTypes => ({
  productSlug: {
    label: 'Product Slug URI Identifier',
    type: ElementPropTypes.readOnly,
    isPrivate: true,
  },
})
```

**Note:** If you want this value to be editable in the block's settings panel by you or your agency members, you can use `ElementPropTypes.string` instead.

## 2. Set Your defaultConfig to Use 'pageVar:pageUrlText'

Locate the definition of your `defaultConfig` in your block code. Set the value for your pageVar property to be `'pageVar:pageUrlText'`.

Example:

```javascript
export const defaultConfig = { productSlug: 'pageVar:pageUrlText' }
```

## 3. Use the pageVar in Your getDataProps Function

The property that you added to your configSchema will now be available for use in your block's `getDataProps` function. You can use it to retrieve the product data.

Example:

```javascript
export const getDataProps = (utils, { productSlug }) => {
  return utils.client.products
    .getBySlug(productSlug)
    .then(product => {
      product
    })
    .catch(() => {})
}
```

**Note:** The second argument to `getDataProps()` is the block's props, which are destructured in place.

`getDataProps` gets called like this in your block:

```javascript
getDataProps(window.ElementSdk, props)
```

## 4. Set Your Page Path to Use :pageUrlText

1. In your Volusion Dashboard, navigate to **Site Designer**.
2. If you are not already editing your theme, click the **edit** (or **continue editing**) button to open your theme.
3. Click the **pages dropdown** to expand it.
4. Click the **gear icon** for the page that the block will appear on (for example, "Product Details").
5. The settings panel should now be open for your page, and you should see a field for "Page Path." Ensure that the value at the end of the path is `:pageUrlText`. For example, on the Product Details page, the correct Page Path would be `/p/:pageUrlText`.

## More Data from the URI: Read Query Params from Block Props

Your block's `props` also contain some extra data that can be useful in combination with the pageVar data.

**`props.queryParams`** returns an object with the query params from the page URI.

For example, the URI `https://myvolusionstore.com/c/shirts?page=2&sortBy=Lowest%20Price` will return the following value for `props.queryParams` in your block code:

```javascript
{
    page: '2',
    sortBy: 'Lowest Price'
}
```

### Query Params Are Also Available in getDataProps

```javascript
export const getDataProps = (utils, props) => {
  // you can use props.queryParams here (or queryParams if you destructured the props argument)
```

As an example, you could use query params to figure out which page of results the shopper is viewing, and return corresponding products from the Volusion API.

```javascript
export const getDataProps = (utils, props) => {
  const { queryParams = {} } = props

  const categoryId = 'something hard coded or from another API request'
  const page = Number(queryParams.page) || 1
  const sortMethod = queryParams.sortBy || props.defaultSortMethod
  return utils.client.products
    .getByCategoryId({
      categoryId,
      pageSize,
      page,
      sortMethod,
    })
    .then((data = {}) => {
      // transform data
    })
    .catch(() => {
      // catch error and return a default response
    })
}
```
