## 1. Open Your Theme in Site Designer

Navigate to Site Designer. If you are not already editing your live theme, click the **edit** (or **continue editing**) button to open your theme.

## 2. Select Add a Page

Open the pages dropdown. By default, it will say "Page: Home." Select the **Add a Page** option at the bottom.

## 3. Your Experience May Vary

Depending on your store, you may manage pages in Site Designer, or in Volusion Admin.

### 3a. Add a Page in Volusion Admin

For some stores, choosing "Add a Page" will take you to [Volusion Admin Add A Page](https://admin.volusion.com/pages/add). If that is the case, create a page there. The "Pages" Template page, available from the same pages drop-down, handles the content display for pages created in admin.

If Site Designer redirected you to Volusion Admin, this concludes these instructions for you.

### 3b. Add a Page in Site Designer

If the "New Blank Page" sidebar opened up and you were not redirected to Volusion Admin, then you should see four fields.

## 4. Page Title and Path Fields

Fill out the page title. The page path must start with a `/`; for example: `/sample-page`. Here are some tips:

- Use hyphens to separate words
- Use lowercase letters
- Keep the path short and related to the content

## 5. SEO Fields

The SEO Title and SEO Description fields may be completed now or later.

## 6. Done

Press the **Done** button at the bottom of the form to save your changes.
