## 1. Open Your Theme in Site Designer

Navigate to Site Designer. If you are not already editing your live theme, click the **edit** (or **continue editing**) button to open your theme.

## 2. Select the Master Template for Editing

Look for the page selector dropdown. By default, you should be editing your home page, and the dropdown button will display "**Page: Home**". Click the dropdown button and select **Master Template** from the available options.

## 3. Add Blocks to the Master Template

You should now be viewing the Master Template. This should be evident by the page selector dropdown displaying "**Page: Master Template**", and a Page Content placeholder area displaying in the body of your page.

The Master Template has two sections where you can add blocks: the top of the page, and the bottom of the page. Hover your mouse over one of the existing blocks in one of these sections to reveal the plus icon button.

To add the block:

1. Click the plus icon button, which will open the Add a Block menu
2. Select a block category from the Add a Block menu
3. Choose a block to add, then click the Add Block button

## 4. See Your Block on All Your Site Pages

Now you have added the block, you should see it displayed on the Master Template page. Navigate to other places to see that the block is now on all your site pages:

* Select a page (such as Home) from the page selector dropdown to see the block on other pages in Site Designer
* Click the Preview or View Live Store buttons to see the block on your site
