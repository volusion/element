## 1. Figure Out What Block(s) you Will Use

You need at least one block that reads the pageVar from the URI. This can be an existing block like Related Products or a block that you created yourself and set up to use the pageVar. If you want to use your own block, see "[Read Page URI Parameters In Blocks](/how-to/read-page-uri-parameters-in-blocks)."

## 2. Start Creating a New Page

Add a page to your theme in Site Designer. For a full guide, see "[Add a Page to a Theme](/how-to/add-page-to-theme)." You'll probably follow these steps:

1. Navigate to Site Designer. If you are not already editing your theme, click the **edit** (or **continue editing**) button to open your theme.
2. Open the pages drop-down. By default, it will say "Page: Home." Select the **Add a Page** option at the bottom.
3. Fill out the "Page Title" field.

## 3. Configure the Page Path Using :pageUrlText

- The page path must start with a `/`
- The page path must end with `/:pageUrlText`
- Example: `/special-features/:pageUrlText`

Here are some tips:

- Use hyphens to separate words
- Use lowercase letters
- Keep the path short and related to the content

Your block will get the value in the store's actual page URI, not `:pageUrlText`, so make sure you configure your block to handle the actual URI value.

For example, for a URI with `/special-features/modern-teapot`, your block would receive the value `modern-teapot`.

See "[Read Page URI Parameters In Blocks](/how-to/read-page-uri-parameters-in-blocks)" for more details.

## 4. Finish Creating the Page

Skip the SEO fields for now and click the **Done** button at the bottom of the form.

## 5. Add Your Block(s) to the Page

After creating the page, Site Designer will load your new page for you to edit. The page body will not have any blocks yet.

1. Click the **plus icon** button, which will open the "Add a Block" menu.
2. Select a block category from the "Add a Block" menu.
3. Choose your URI-param-reading block to add, then click the **Add Block** button.

Repeat for all blocks you want to add to the page.

## 6. Linking to Your Page

Now that you've created your page, you need to link to it.

1. Hard code a link to a specific resource. For example, if you are buying advertising that will link to an article about a specific product, it might look something like this: `/product-article/desk-lamp`
2. Build a block that builds links dynamically using data from the [Volusion API that you get through Element SDK](/references/sdk).
