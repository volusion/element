title: "Reuse A Block Across Pages"
---

This document will show how to share a block's settings between instances of that block on more than one page. This is like [adding block to your template](/how-to/add-blocks-to-templates), except that it does not need to be in the header or footer. It will not be on every page of the site, only the pages you put it on.

## 1. Open Your Theme in Site Designer

Navigate to Site Designer. If you are not already editing your live theme, click the **edit** (or **continue editing**) button to open your theme.

## 2. Add or Edit the Block You Wish to Reuse

Add a block to the page, or edit an existing one that you wish to appear on more than one page.

## 3. Make This Block Reusable

Flip the switch labeled "Make this block reusable".

**Warning:** once you make a block reusable it will remain reusable and cannot switch back. If you want a unique copy of this block you may add the same block again. This is an experimental new feature, we want to hear from you if this becomes a problem.

## 4. Switch Pages

Use the "Page" dropdown in the header to edit another page, or add a new one.

## 5. My Blocks

Click the plus icon to begin the process of adding a block. Notice that you are viewing the "Default Blocks" tab. Click on the "My Blocks" tab.

## 6. Rename the Block

Click on the configuration icon to the left of the name of the block you made reusable. Select "Rename" from the menu. Enter a new name and submit the form to save it.

## 7. Add the Block

Click on the name of the block to add it to the page.

## 6. Edit the Block

When you edit the block you will see it has the same settings as on the previous page. If you make changes to the block from any page, those changes will appear on all pages that share the block.
