title: 'Adding a Blog'
---

Usually, incorporating a blog into your store involves redirecting your users to another domain (or subdomain) like `blog.mystore.com`. This means that your blog is hosted on a totally separate platform, so you must invest time and money creating a similar look and feel for your blog while keeping up with two different domains. Additionally, you are sacrificing SEO value by not having your blog hosted as a route in your main domain (`www.yourstore.com/blog`)

With Element, you can avoid all that. By creating a `/blog` page to your store and adding the appropriate blocks, you can offer a first class experience to users who are reading your content. You will also be reusing the same store's theme, reducing maintenance costs.

You can even increase sales by embedding "Add to Cart" operations—or any kind of actions that users can normally do from the store—from your blog posts.

To see how easily you can add a blog, read our "[Building an Element Page Tutorial](/tutorials/building-an-element-page)," where all the steps are described from start to finish.

Remember that this Element benefit is not limited to blogs—you can incorporate any kind of application to your store, such as Q&As, reviews, and more.
