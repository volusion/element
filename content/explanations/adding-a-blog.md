title: 'Adding a Blog'
---

Generally speaking when you want to incorporate a blog into your store, you will have to redirect your users to some other domain (or subdomain) like `blog.mystore.com`.
That means that your blog is hosted in a totally different platform and you have to invest time and money creating a similar look and feel for your blog.

If you have invested in creating a nice header and footer for your store for example, you will have to create it again possibly in a totally different platform. Not to mention
that you now need to care about your store's hosting and your blog's hosting.

Also, if you want your users to use the cart from your blog shoppers will have to be linked to a new page. As a result of that, you can't have a first class experience from your blog
to add products to the cart or check cart details without abandoning the blog page.

Additionally, you are sacrificing SEO value by not having your blog hosted as a route in your main domain (`www.yourstore.com/blog`)

But with Element you can avoid all that. By creating a `/blog` page to your store and adding the appropriate blocks, you will be able to offer a first class
experience to your users while reading your content. As a result, you can have another point to increase sales by embedding add to cart operations from
your blog posts or any kind of actions that users can normally do from the store. Also you are reusing the same store's theme, reducing maintenance costs.

To see how easily you can add a blog, read our [Building an Element Page Tutorial](/tutorials/building-an-element-page) where all the steps are described from start to finish.

Remember that this Element benefit is not limited to blogs. You can incorporate any kind of application to your store like Q&A, reviews and others.
