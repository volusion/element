### Speed

We take speed seriously.

- We developed state of the art Server Side Rendering (SSR) technologies to achieve the fastest experiences possible.
- Content is automatically minified, cached, and populated in CDNs for you.
- Our serving technology auto-scaled based on demand, ensuring consistently fast speeds even under heavy, spikey traffic.
- Element is [Google AMP](https://developers.google.com/amp) ready, so you can build your sites to take [advantage of AMP](https://amp.dev/about/how-amp-works/) speed. Developers can progressively add AMP support to your page by making sure you follow some [simple techniques](http://simple-amp-techniques) when developing on Element. But no need to worry, if you don't want to be AMP ready by default your sites will still be [super fast](http://keeping-sites-fast).

### SEO

As the full markup of the site is generated on the server, search engines will get all the content to rank your sites better. Developers have full control over all aspects of SEO custom tags and content.

### Developer friendliness
