### Speed

- We developed state-of-the art Server-Side Rendering (SSR) technologies to achieve the fastest experiences possible.
- Content is automatically minified, cached, and populated in CDNs for you.
- Our serving technology auto-scales based on demand, ensuring consistently fast speeds even under heavy traffic.
- Element is [Google AMP](https://developers.google.com/amp)-ready, so you can build your sites to [take advantage of AMP speed](https://amp.dev/about/how-amp-works/). But don't worry—if you don't want to be AMP ready by default, your sites will still be fast.

### SEO

As the full markup of the site is generated on the server, search engines will get all the content they need to rank your sites better. Developers have full control over all aspects of custom tags and content.

### Developer friendliness

Element provides the full power of Javascript and React—no need to learn a custom programming language or an antiquated templating system. Additionally, we handle hosting, caching, and CDN delivery for you so that you can focus on building your site.
